## Architecture
We use MVVM (Model View ViewModel) design pattern with a Clean Architecture with Modularization. MVVM is a GUI-based application development architecture that focuses on the separation between code for business logic and application views. In its application, MVVM is divided into several layers, namely Model, View, and ViewModel. The following is a discussion of the three layers below.
